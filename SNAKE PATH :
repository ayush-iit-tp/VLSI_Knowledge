SNAKE PATH :
I found some information about snake paths on ChipVerify. 
A snake path is a path that goes through different levels of hierarchies and returns to the same level where it started from. 
These paths should be avoided because they can create complex and hard-to-debug designs.

module snake_path (
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst,
    output reg [3:0] x, y // Coordinates of the snake's head
);
    reg [1:0] direction; // 0: right, 1: down, 2: left, 3: up

    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
        if (rst) begin
            x <= 0;
            y <= 0;
            direction <= 0;
        end else begin
            case (direction)
                0: if (x < 15) x <= x + 1; else direction <= 1; // Move right
                1: if (y < 15) y <= y + 1; else direction <= 2; // Move down
                2: if (x > 0) x <= x - 1; else direction <= 3; // Move left
                3: if (y > 0) y <= y - 1; else direction <= 0; // Move up
            endcase
        end
    end
endmodule

Explanation
Module Declaration: Declares the snake_path module with inputs for the clock (clk) and reset (rst), and outputs for the coordinates of the snake's head (x, y).

Direction Register: Uses a 2-bit register to store the current direction of the snake (0: right, 1: down, 2: left, 3: up).

Always Block: The always block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock or the reset signal.

Reset Condition: If the reset signal is asserted, the coordinates and direction are reset.

Movement Logic: The snake moves in the current direction until it reaches the edge of the grid, then changes direction.
